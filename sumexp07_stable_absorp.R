# Improved absorption optimisation without the instability
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Instability was introduced when the intercepts were taken out of log-transform
# Can we achieve the same results with intercepts in the log domain?
# Boundaries were a big reason for the change but...
# These boundaries are implicit with a log-transform!
# Another reason for the change was the new absorption optimisation...
# But we can transform, find the sum and then transform back!
